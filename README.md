# Weather Forecasting with MLflow Analysis
This project aims to predict the weather using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle through machine learning algorithms. After analyzing the features of the dataset and selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm with MLflow, the model is trained to perform weather forecasting.

Analyzed Machine Learning Models:

LR (Logistic Regression)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
DT (Decision Tree)
NB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)
RF (Random Forest)
KA (K-Adaptive)
